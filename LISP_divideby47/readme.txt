In this code, we define a function is-divisible-by-2 that takes a number n as an argument and returns t if it is divisible by 2 and nil otherwise. We then set the value of n to 47 and call the function to determine if 47 is divisible by 2. Finally, we use the format function to print the result in a readable format. The output will be:

csharp
Copy code
47 is divisible by 2: NIL
This indicates that 47 is not divisible by 2.

Regarding the memory layout, in LISP, values and functions are stored as linked lists, where each element is a cons cell that contains a car and a cdr field. The car field stores the value of the element, and the cdr field stores a reference to the next element in the list. In this example, the function is-divisible-by-2 would be stored as a cons cell with car set to the function definition and cdr set to nil. The value 47 would be stored as a separate cons cell with car set to 47 and cdr set to nil. The output of the format function would be stored in a string data structure, and the memory layout of that data structure would depend on the implementation of LISP being used.
