%Design an efficient model to check the path between two nodes in a given graph using prolog.You can write your own relations

% Define the relation edge(X, Y) which represents an edge between node X and node Y.
edge(a, b).
edge(a, c).
edge(b, c).
edge(c, d).

% Define the relation path(X, Y, Path) which returns the path from node X to node Y.
path(X, Y, [X, Y]) :- edge(X, Y).
path(X, Y, [X | Path]) :- edge(X, Z), path(Z, Y, Path).

% Check if a path exists between node A and node B.
path_exists(A, B) :- path(A, B, _).
